# SQL-Airline-ER-Model

A team of Scott Oxholm, Rachael Walker, Rob Grzesiuk and I created an entity relationship model for an airline using SQL. 

* ER Notes creates the domains for the attributes used in the model, details the relationship keys, and justifies the IsA Constraints. 
* The SQL Create Table document uses the created domains to code the create table statements in SQL. It also explains how to enforce the covering constraints for the IsA relationships.
* The diagram can also be seen in the visio file.
